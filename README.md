# iow_lead_dash
This repo holds a shiny app to allow users to select a water utility and see what buildings were constructed before a desired year.

The app is located here: https://internetofwater.shinyapps.io/iow_lead_dash/

The repo is organized in two folders, a processing folder and shinny app folder. If starting from scratch, you will need to run the processing/src/data_prep_final.R script. There are data files that will need to be downloaded and placed in the data folder, follow comments to find these datasets.
